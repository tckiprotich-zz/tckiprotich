üí° Hi there, I'm a skilled developer with expertise in .NET, databases, JavaScript, and Python.

As a skilled backend developer, I thrive in highly collaborative work environments and take pride in finding solutions that result in customer satisfaction. I have experience designing and developing web applications with multiple APIs, third-party integrations, and databases. This versatility allows me to work efficiently in diverse environments.

I am also a multidisciplinary designer with a curious mind. I enjoy meeting new people and understanding how they solve problems, as it helps me improve as a professional. This curiosity has allowed me to incorporate innovative design concepts into my software development solutions, resulting in a more user-friendly experience for customers.
